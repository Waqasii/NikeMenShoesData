1,What The Paul,N/A,Mens Shoes & Sneakers,N/A,"Few athletes ever receive the honor of having a single signature shoeâ€”Paul Rodriguez now has 10 to his name. In recognition of that longstanding lineage, this Dunk incorporates details from memorable colorways of each of those styles, resulting in an eclectic tapestry that celebrates the rich stories behind every material, graphic and hue we've seen over the course of P-Rod's run with Nike Skateboarding.
Mismatched makeups on the each shoe highlight some of the most iconic elements from P-Rod's signature line, with ornate embroidery, wild prints, colorful gradients and a range of premium textures blending to turn familiar features into something entirely new.
